# Kingdoms

## Creation and Inviting

Open the Kingdoms GUI with the chat command '/k' or by using the inventory button. You will be presented with two options, one to create a kingdom and the other to accept an invitation to join another kingdom.
Either way you join a kindom, you will be greeted with the standard kingdoms interface where you can (according to your level in the kingdom) view your kingdom's status, manage the kingdom's members, invite new members, or access other kingdom settings.

## Claiming Land

Without a land claim, you would be forced to hide from other players who would have unrestricted ability to destroy your work. This is solved by the presence of *Corestones*, which, once placed, claim a 50x50x50 cube of land where nobody else can build or access devices unless they have an appropriate level in the kingdom.
These claims cannot overlap with other claims, and must be spaced with at least 50 nodes between their areas so that there is plenty of neutral land that cannot be claimed. They also cannot be placed below -32y, avoiding claiming of mining zones.

50x50x50 is somewhat restrictive, however, and even the neutral area around a corestone could be consumed by larger kingdoms. Outside of the neutral area, there is a possibility that a new corestone could be placed, undermining all the building you have done there. To counter this, you can place *Claim wards*, which prevent corestones from being placed if the ward would land inside the claimed zone.

## Defending Land

Defending a neutral area, or even preventing enemies from entering your clamied area, is enhanced beyond personal battle by the addition of several nodes:

* Turrets, which, after a missile or shield spell is inserted, will ward off enemies by blasting spells at them and cancel or subdue enemy spells.
* Materializers and Materialized Walls. The Walls act like hard stone, but when a Materializer is placed by them they will level from 1 to 4 over time. A level 4 node, when dug, will revert to a level 3 instead of vanishing, and so on down to a level 1. They will also absorb explosions, preventing damage inside them.

## Destroying a Corestone

The ability to take over another kingdom's claim is a large part of the game, and this is facilitated by *Core Disruptors*. When placed within a 75x75x75 cube centered around the target corestone, the target's *corestone score* will begin to decrease slowly, lowering faster depending on how many disruptors you can place. When this score reaches zero, the corestone will vanish and you can pillage the now-unprotected area.

### Defense

In order to protect your corestone score and allow it to naturally regenerate, you must destroy any attacking disruptors. Any expensive disruptors gained in battle can then be turned against your enemies, so a successful defense will help you and harm your enemies greatly.
You can place traps, turrets, wards, and fight personally to drive the attackers away from their disruptors.

# Magic

Closely integrated with the kingdoms mod is the magic mod, which provides many attacking and defending options.

## Crystals

Use of magic begins with Magic Crystals, of which most are found underground:

* Rage (Red)
* Calm (Blue)
* Solidity (Yellow)
* Vitality (Green)
* Area (Teal)
* Control (Purple)

Some crystals must be produced through machiney:

* Night (Grey), produced through *Nightcalls*
* Day (White), produced through *Daypulls*

## Essences

Crystals can be melted into essences, which are the basic form of magic. When combined with spellbinding materials such as silver, essences can be merged into larger magical devices, or converted into spells.

## Spells

Spells are the most active form of magic. They are items which you can hold, and their use will drain upon your mana.
There are three kinds of spells:

* Attack: These include Fireballs, Bombs, and Missiles, each of which deal different kinds of damage and are thrown by left-clicking with them.
* Defense: This includes spells such as shields, which can be held in the hand and will be consumed to counter damage thrown at you from spells or explosions.
* Action: Other spells are in this category, such as a spell to drop flowing water over a small area or a spell to change water sources into ice (which also deals cold damage).

## Mana

Each player has a mana count, which regenerates slowly, speeding up if the player is nearly or at full health.

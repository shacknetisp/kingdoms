# Kingdoms

## Creation and Inviting

Open the Kingdoms GUI with the chat command '/k' or by using the inventory button. You will be presented with two options, one to create a kingdom and the other to accept an invitation to join another kingdom.
Either way you join a kindom, you will be greeted with the standard kingdoms interface where you can (according to your level in the kingdom) view your kingdom's status, manage the kingdom's members, invite new members, or access other kingdom settings.

## Claiming Land

Without a land claim, you would be forced to hide from other players who would have unrestricted ability to destroy your work. This is solved by the presence of *Corestones*, which, once placed, claim a 64x64x64 cube of land where nobody else can build or access devices unless they have an appropriate level in the kingdom.
These claims cannot overlap with other claims, and must be spaced with at least 64 nodes between their areas so that there is plenty of neutral land that cannot be claimed. They also cannot be placed below -32y, avoiding claiming of mining zones.

64x64x64 is somewhat restrictive, however, and even the neutral area around a corestone could be consumed by larger kingdoms. Outside of the neutral area, there is a possibility that a new corestone could be placed, undermining all the building you have done there. To counter this, you can place *Claim wards*, which prevent corestones from being placed if the ward would land inside the claimed zone.

## Defending Land

Defending a neutral area, or even preventing enemies from entering your clamied area, is enhanced beyond personal battle by the addition of materializers.

* Materializers and Materialized Walls. The Walls act like hard stone, but when a Materializer is placed by them they will level from 1 to 4 over time. A level 4 node, when dug, will revert to a level 3 instead of vanishing, and so on down to a level 1. They will also absorb explosions, preventing damage inside them.

## Destroying a Corestone

The ability to take over another kingdom's claim is a large part of the game, and this is facilitated by *Core Disruptors*. When placed within a 96x96x96 cube centered around the target corestone, the target's *corestone score* will begin to decrease slowly, lowering faster depending on how many disruptors you can place. When this score reaches zero, the corestone will vanish and you can pillage the now-unprotected area.

### Defense

In order to protect your corestone score and allow it to naturally regenerate, you must destroy any attacking disruptors. Any expensive disruptors gained in battle can then be turned against your enemies, so a successful defense will help you and harm your enemies greatly.
